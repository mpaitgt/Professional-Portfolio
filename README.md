# Portfolio

I recently redesigned my portfolio in an effort to give it more functionality and make it a better experience for the user.

- I branded the site better with a more defined color scheme and consistent use of typography with a hierarchy to it.
- Previously I hadn't have a navbar so much as a home screen because of the layout that I designed. So I decided to give myself a proper navbar that scroll when clicked to the desired section of the page. I also added some cool hover animations with some CSS and JavaScript.
- I overhauled the Skills/Work/Projects section and made it more engaging for the user. With CSS and JavaScript, I'm now rendering different projects based on the skill the user selects from an array of buttons.
- I'm currently working to seek out some recommendations to build out this section.
- Instead of just slapping an anchor tag to Bandcamp and calling it a day, I'm now allowing users to listen right on my page while browsing the rest of the portfolio. I did this by building a custom modal with an iFrame, and with - you guessed it - CSS and JavaScript I'm able to swap out the src link based on the album selected.
