# Portfolio

My portfolio was developed with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, and I like to keep it that way! It's served as somewhat of a playground where I've learned a bunch of great things, like how to...

- Make fluid list animations for user interaction
- Develop a fluid show/hide accordion feature
- Create sortable lists with preset filters
- Improve the mobile navigation experience
- Integrate SVG into web layouts
- Swap iFrames and build custom modals
- Learn and practice modern, animated input field trends
